In the 1960s, computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum wrote a computer program named ELIZA that

parodied a conversation with a psychotherapist. ELIZA responded, using scripted replies, to simple

sentences typed in by the user. For this project, I will implement a very basic Python version of ELIZA.

Simple fun project!
