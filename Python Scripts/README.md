These are some of the python scripts I got to work on. Some are pretty straight forward on what they do.

Extracting_Notes_HTML.py is a script I wrote that would take an HTML page, in this case a tumblr page, and it would extract the 
highest amount of note shares and return it to you. 

Removing_HTML_CODE.py is a script that would delete some unwanted html code/tags and produce a new HTML file for you.

CMD commands and Install_NEXT scripts were use for a personal project where I had to make a batch script to install programs
as well as remove folder permissions. I just quickly generated the commands in the scripts. 

For the xcell scripts, the folder
permissions user information was stored in an excell sheet. I attemtped at trying to read the excell sheet by color and return
only the color that certain users were colored as to distingish them.
