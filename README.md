# 📚 College Python Scripts Collection

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to my treasure trove of Python scripts, a collection of projects that I not only developed during my college years at Stony Brook University but also used as teaching tools while serving as a Teacher Assistant. Each script here is more than just a set of commands; they are the essence of knowledge shared and lessons learned.

## 🤖 About the Scripts

These scripts represent a spectrum of assignments and projects I undertook, showcasing my journey through the complexities of coding and problem-solving. They are a testament to my growth as a developer and my commitment to aiding fellow students in their coding voyage.

## 👨‍🏫 My Role as a Teacher Assistant

As a Teacher Assistant, I had the unique opportunity to not only work on these scripts but also to pass the baton of knowledge to the next generation of students. These scripts were tools through which I could convey complex concepts in a digestible manner, aiding students in overcoming the hurdles of coding.

## 🤝 Contributing and Feedback

I warmly welcome contributions and feedback. If you have suggestions, improvements, or want to discuss the scripts, please feel free to reach out or create an issue/pull request on GitHub.
