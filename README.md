# Python-Scripts
These are just a few Python Scripts I worked on. Some may be hard to understand but as it shows, I start to better understand scripting and making things more fluent.

I have a it of algorithm practice that I learned from my data structure course and applied it to Python so I have a couple of scripts in that folder.

I have a mini project I did to help teach a course in my time as a teacher assistant student in Stony Brook University. 

I also experimented with Python Turtle Graphics. I started realizing python was more than just organinzing data, so I ventured out of my comfort zone to try something new! I personally like the checker one.

And finally I have messy compilation of cool python scripts I have in one folder. My lastest one was just trying to see if I can automate folder permissions using CMD commands, and that lead me to importing excel libraries.
